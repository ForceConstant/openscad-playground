This is a limited port of [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) to WebAssembly, using at its core a headless WASM build of OpenSCAD ([done by @DSchroer](https://github.com/DSchroer/openscad-wasm)), wrapped in a UI made of pretty [PrimeReact](https://github.com/primefaces/primereact) components, a [React Monaco editor](https://github.com/react-monaco-editor/react-monaco-editor) (VS Codesque power!), and an interactive [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/) renderer.

It defaults to the [Manifold backend](https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/4533) so it's **super** fast.

Enjoy!

Licenses: see [LICENSES](./LICENSE).

## Features

- Automatic preview on edit (F5), and full rendering on Ctrl+Enter (or F6). Using a trick to force $preview=true.
- [Customizer](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Customizer) support
- Syntax highlighting
- Ships with many standard SCAD libraries (can browse through them in the UI)
- Autocomplete of imports
- Autocomplete of symbols / function calls (pseudo-parses file and its transitive imports)
- Responsive layout. On small screens editor and viewer are stacked onto each other, while on larger screens they can be side-by-side
- Installable as a PWA (then persists edits in localStorage instead of the hash fragment). On iOS just open the sharing panel and tap "Add to Home Screen". *Should not* require any internet connectivity once cached.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add tests!
- [x] Persist camera state
- [x] Support 2D somehow? (e.g. add option in OpenSCAD to output 2D geometry as non-closed polysets, or to auto-extrude by some height)
- [x] Proper Preview rendering: have OpenSCAD export the preview scene to a rich format (e.g. glTF, with some parts being translucent when prefixed w/ % modifier) and display it using https://modelviewer.dev/ maybe)
- ~~Rebuild w/ (and sync) ochafik@'s filtered kernel (https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/4160) to fix(ish) 2D operations~~
- [x] Bundle more examples (ask users to contribute)
- Animation rendering (And other formats than STL)
- [x] Compress URL fragment
- [x] Mobile (iOS) editing support: switch to https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-codemirror ?
- [x] Replace Makefile w/ something that reads the libs metadata
- [ ] Merge modifiers rendering code to openscad
- Model /home fs in shared state. have two clear paths: /libraries for builtins, and /home for user data. State pointing to /libraries paths needs not store the data except if there's overrides (flagged as modifications in the file picker)
- Drag and drop of files (SCAD, STL, etc) and Zip archives. For assets, auto insert the corresponding import.
- Fuller PWA support w/ link Sharing, File opening / association to *.scad files... 
- Look into accessibility
- Setup [OPENSCADPATH](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries#Setting_OPENSCADPATH) env var w/ Emscripten to ensure examples that include assets / import local files will run fine.
- Detect which bundled libraries are included / used in the sources and only download these rather than wait for all of the zips. Means the file explorer would need to be more lazy or have some prebuilt hierarchy.
- Preparse builtin libraries definitions at compile time, ship the JSON.

## Docker

A multi-stage [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) builds the playground and serves the
static output with nginx. The app is built once and only the small runtime image
is built per architecture, so the image is published for both `linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64`.

```bash
docker build -t openscad-playground .
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 openscad-playground
# open http://localhost:8080/
```

Or use the example [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Released images are published to the GitHub Container Registry as
`ghcr.io/<owner>/openscad-playground`:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/<owner>/openscad-playground:latest
```

### Releasing

Releases are **tag-driven**. The version in the tag is the single source of
truth for the Docker tags and the GitHub Release:

```bash
# 1. bump "version" in package.json, then commit
# 2. tag and push
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "v0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Stable tags publish `0.2.0`, `0.2`, `0` and `latest`; pre-release tags such as
`v0.2.0-rc.1` are published as GitHub pre-releases and never move `latest`.
See [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Server-side model files (optional)

The playground is a static, browser-only app by default: files live in the
browser (in memory or `localStorage`) and sharing is done with URL fragments.

This fork adds an **optional server-side file store**, so that:

* the file dropdown lists every model in a shared server folder;
* a file added by an agent (or anyone) shows up for **every** open browser,
  no matter which host it runs on;
* edits are saved back to the server folder.

It is two pieces:

| Piece | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `files-api` | a tiny, dependency-free Node service that serves a folder over HTTP (`GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/files/...`) |
| client sync | `src/fs/server-sync.ts` mirrors that folder into the in-browser filesystem (so the picker shows it) and pushes edits back |

### Running it

Use [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml), which starts both services and
mounts a host folder for the models:

```bash
mkdir -p ./models && sudo chown 1000:1000 ./models   # writable by the `node` user
docker compose up -d
# open http://localhost:8080/
```

Then:

* every `.scad` file in `./models` appears in the file dropdown (under a
  `server` folder);
* **Ctrl/Cmd+S** (or the cloud button) saves the open file back to `./models`;
* **New file** / **Delete current file** in the editor menu manage server files;
* other open browsers pick up changes within a few seconds.

Server storage is enabled at build time with `SERVER_FILES_API=/api` (the
Docker image sets this). A build without it makes **no** server requests, so a
plain static deployment stays error-free. It can also be enabled at runtime by
setting `window.__OPENSCAD_FILES_API__` before the bundle loads.

### files-api configuration

| Env | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FILES_DIR` | `/data/models` | folder to serve |
| `PORT` | `8080` | listen port |
| `ALLOWED_EXT` | `.scad,.json` | extensions exposed (comma-separated) |
| `MAX_BYTES` | `5242880` | maximum upload size |

Served image: `ghcr.io/<owner>/openscad-files-api`.

## Building

The project uses a **webpack-based build system** that reads library metadata from `libs-config.json` to automatically download, clone, and package OpenSCAD libraries and dependencies. This replaces the previous Makefile approach with a more standard, maintainable solution.

Prerequisites:
*   wget or curl
*   Node.js (>=22)
*   npm
*   git
*   zip
*   Docker able to run amd64 containers (only needed if building WASM from source). If running on a different platform (including Silicon Mac), you can add support for amd64 images through QEMU with:

  ```bash
  docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
  ```

Local dev:

```bash
npm run build:libs  # Download WASM and build all OpenSCAD libraries
npm install
npm run start
# http://localhost:4000/
```

Local prod (test both the different inlining and serving under a prefix):

```bash
npm run build:libs  # Download WASM and build all OpenSCAD libraries
npm install
npm run start:production
# http://localhost:3000/dist/
```

Deployment (edit "homepage" in `package.json` to match your deployment root!):

```bash
npm run build:all  # Build libraries and compile the application
npm install

rm -fR ../ochafik.github.io/openscad2 && cp -R dist ../ochafik.github.io/openscad2 
# Now commit and push changes, wait for site update and enjoy!
```

## Build your own WASM binary

The build system fetches a prebuilt OpenSCAD web WASM binary, but you can build your own in a couple of minutes:

- **Optional**: use your own openscad fork / branch:

  ```bash
  rm -fR libs/openscad
  ln -s $PWD/../absolute/path/to/your/openscad libs/openscad
  
  # If you had a native build directory, delete it.
  rm -fR libs/openscad/build
  ```

- Build WASM binary (add `WASM_BUILD=Debug` argument if you'd like to debug any cryptic crashes):

  ```bash
  npm run build:libs:wasm
  ```

- Then continue the build:

  ```bash
  npm run build:libs
  npm run start
  ```

## Adding OpenSCAD libraries

The build system uses a webpack plugin that reads from `libs-config.json` to manage all library dependencies. You'll need to update 3 files (search for BOSL2 for an example):

- [libs-config.json](./libs-config.json): to add the library's metadata including repository URL, branch, and files to include/exclude in the zip archive

- [src/fs/zip-archives.ts](./src/fs/zip-archives.ts): to use the `.zip` archive in the UI (both for file explorer and automatic imports mounting)

- [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md): most libraries require proper disclosure of their usage and of their license. If a license is unique, paste it in full, otherwise, link to one of the standard ones already there.

### Library Configuration Format

In `libs-config.json`, add an entry like this:

```json
{
  "name": "LibraryName",
  "repo": "https://github.com/user/repo.git", 
  "branch": "main",
  "zipIncludes": ["*.scad", "LICENSE", "examples"],
  "zipExcludes": ["**/tests/**"],
  "workingDir": "."
}
```

Available build commands:
- `npm run build:libs` - Build all libraries
- `npm run build:libs:clean` - Clean all build artifacts
- `npm run build:libs:wasm` - Download/build just the WASM binary
- `npm run build:libs:fonts` - Download/build just the fonts
